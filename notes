need to add...

    castling            <<< moving the rook and king at the same time
            king moves two spaces towards the rook and the rook moves to the other side of the king, king cannot be in check

    en passant      <<< capturing a pawn that just moved two spaces
            if a pawn moves two spaces, the next turn you can capture it as if it only moved one space

    pawn promotion  <<< pawn reaching the other side of the board, becoming a queen
            pawn becomes a queen, rook, bishop, or knight after the pawn reaches the other side of the board

    check           <<< king is in danger of being captured, thus you must block it to continue
            king is in danger of being captured, thus you must dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge it to continue
